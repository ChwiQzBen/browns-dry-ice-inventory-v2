app/core/cheese_forecast_adapter.py
=====================================
Adapts the Dry Ice app's AdvancedForecaster (Prophet/XGBoost/LightGBM/
RandomForest/ARIMA/LSTM/Monte Carlo ensemble, app/core/advanced_forecasting_v2.py)
to the plain callable(cheese_name, daily_sales_kg) -> (mean, std) signature
that CheeseDemandForecaster(ml_forecaster=...) expects.

Kept as its own module — NOT inside demand_forecast.py — so importing
demand_forecast.py never pulls in xgboost/prophet/tensorflow/etc. unless
you actually opt into ML forecasting for cheese. demand_forecast.py stays
usable (rolling-stats fallback) even if this module's imports fail.

MODEL SUBSET: only prophet/xgboost/lightgbm/random_forest run by default,
NOT neural_prophet/arima/lstm. Two reasons, both already-hit problems on
the Dry Ice side of this app:
  1. LSTM requires tensorflow, which was previously missing from
     requirements.txt and caused it to fail silently — and Streamlit Cloud
     already hit a typing_extensions version conflict once. Pulling that
     same dependency into a second forecasting path doubles the surface
     area for that exact class of deployment failure.
  2. ARIMA's order search (9 candidate (p,d,q) combinations, each fit
     separately) and LSTM's 100-epoch training are the two slowest models
     in the ensemble — expensive to run synchronously inside a Streamlit
     tab for every cheese in the recipe book, on every cache miss.

Pass `models=[...]` to widen this back to the full 8-model ensemble if
you've confirmed tensorflow is in requirements.txt and are comfortable
with the added latency.
