"""
production_plan.py
====================
Ties recipes, milk allocation, and FEFO stock into ONE object per day's
decision, with plain-language reasons attached to each recommendation.

This is the single idea worth taking from a "proper APS system" pitch:
everything flows through one ProductionPlan object rather than scattered
function calls. It deliberately does NOT bring in base-class hierarchies,
repositories, or a 25-module framework — those solve a team-coordination
problem this project doesn't have.

The explanation pattern below mirrors InventoryDecisionEngine.executive_summary()
in the existing Dry Ice app (app/core/decision_engine.py) — same idea,
applied to the cheese/milk decision instead of the dry ice reorder decision.

CHANGE LOG
----------
- build_plan() now accepts optional aging_room_capacity_kg / aging_room_used_kg
  so the aging-room space constraint is enforced INSIDE the optimization
  (via MilkAllocator's new capacity_by_cheese), not just flagged after the
  fact. Remaining room is applied as a per-line cap on every aged cheese;
  see the note on ProductionPlan.warnings if multiple aged cheeses together
  would still overflow the room (a true joint constraint needs an LP solver,
  which is deliberately out of scope here — this gets you 95% of the value
  with none of the added complexity).
